## #FRAUD DETECTION ON REVIEWS USING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS \

Online shopping has become a widespread habit in modern society, especially with the development and optimization of technology. However, it comes with inherent risks. Online reviews play a crucial role in influencing consumers and boosting brands. However, the increasing prevalence of fraudulent reviews poses significant challenges to maintaining the integrity and fairness of these platforms. This paper presents an in-depth study on fraud detection in reviews, utilizing the YelpChi dataset. We implement and compare two advanced graph-based methods, GraphSAGE and CARE-GNN, for detecting fraudulent activities. Subsequently, we deploy model CARE-GNN and predict fraud detection in reviews. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods in identifying fraudulent reviews, providing detailed insights into their performance metrics with ROC-AUC greater than 0.50 and Recall score greater than 0.65 for both models. Notably, the GraphSAGE model achieves an accuracy of 0.85. This research aims to contribute to the development of more reliable review systems, enhancing user experience, and bolstering business credibility.
